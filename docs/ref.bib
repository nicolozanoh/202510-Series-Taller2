abstract = {This article is a revised version of the lecture the author delivered in Stockholm, Sweden on December 8, 2003, when he received the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. Optimal behavior takes risks that are worthwhile. This is the central paradigm of finance - risks must be taken to achieve rewards but not all risks are equally rewarded. Both the risks and the rewards are in the future, so it is the expectation of loss that is balanced against the expectation of reward. Thus behavior is optimized, and in particular, a portfolio, to maximize rewards and minimize risks. This article describes the genesis of the ARCH model, and discusses some of its many generalizations and widespread empirical support. The article shows how this dynamic model can be used to forecast volatility and risk over a long horizon and how it can be used to value options.},
